A simple Weather app

Goals:

    1. Create a simple app that accepts barangay, city and province of the user. 
    2. Pin the address to the map. 
        a. When the address is invalid, pin the user's current location. 
        b. When permission for location is denied, navigate back the user to the address input screen and show an error that it is required.
    3. When everything is set for the user, be able to pin his location(based on address or current location), get the current weather data based on user's location. You'll use OpenWeatherMap.org.
    
    4. Once you have the weather data, show all the data to screen with the preview of the map with the pin, weather update (usual weather app UI) and the address details.
